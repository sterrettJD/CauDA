Description: Differential abundance testing, as most programs perform it, 
  is incredibly naive. This package exists to incorporate knowledge to make 
  microbiome differential abundance testing more informed. Primary goals include 
  constraining search space and identifying confounding taxa in differential
  abundance testing.
